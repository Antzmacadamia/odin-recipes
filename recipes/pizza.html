    <p1>Making a <em>Pizza</em> is the next best thing to learn 
        after flour tortilla.  It's not too different.  
        Everyone loves pizza, and you should
        learn how to make it from scratch.  You will need</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cup of flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of warm 43C water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of oil</li>
            <li>1 spoon of instant yeast</li>
            <li>salt and/or seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <p2>The <strong>use of yeast</strong>
        is very picky.  You might fail, but can easily
        start again and get a good habit.  
        <strong>Salt will kill</strong> yeast, so don't combine them in water.
        boil your kettle almost half way, add the yeast and sugar, and wait until
        it foams.  Then you are successful.  If it doesnt foam, <strong>try again</strong>.</p2>
    <p3>Next, follow <em>this procedure.</em></p3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients, flour and salt or herbs.</li>
        <li>Add the oil, and mix in. Next add the yeast in warm water</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until its firm and soft.</li>
        <li>The ratio of 1 cup to 1/3 cup of water is perfect, however 
            add more water or flour if needed to get a perfect dough.</li>
        <li>Let the dough sit for 1 hour.  It should rise.  If not, 
            if the yeast was foaming, you may still have a rise of
            your dough in the oven, because your dough is cold.
              Test it!</li>
        <li>Roll round, add toppings, and bake at 200C for 20-25 minutes, depending
            on your oven. </li>
        <li>Eat!</li>
    <p4>And thats the recipe.  I encourage you to try milk instead of water,
        and different herbs.

    <p1>Making a <em>flour tortilla</em> is easy.  It's a recipe
    made by 1/3 of the planet.  You will need</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of oil</li>
        <li>salt and/or seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <p2>The <strong>above amount of ingredients</strong>
    will make 2 medium tortillas, or 1 large 28cm
    flour tortilla.  <strong>Salt</strong> is your basic
    seasoning, however herb mix also works well.</p2>
<p3>Next, follow <em>this procedure.</em></p3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the dry ingredients, flour and salt or herbs.</li>
    <li>Add the oil, and mix in. Next add the water</li>
    <li>Knead the dough until its firm and soft.</li>
    <li>The ratio of 1 cup to 1/3 cup of water is perfect, however 
        add more water or flour if needed to get a perfect dough.</li>
    <li>Let the dough sit for 30 minutes.  The longer it sits,
            up to 2 hours, the better and softer it will be.  Test it!</li>
    <li>Roll flat and fry in a little oil.  Any size you like,
                and as crispy as you like. </li>
    <li>Eat!</li>
<p4>And thats the recipe.  I encourage you to try milk instead of water,
    and different herbs.
